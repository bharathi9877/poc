Regions and Availability zones:

region :It's a separate geographical area.Each aws region has multiple,isolatedlocations known as availability zones.

*EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud):
It's a web service that provides secure,resizable compute capacity in the cloud. we can select from a variety of 
operating systems and resource configurations like cpu,storage that is required for your application.

Pricing models for Amazon EC2:
They are four pricing models for amazon ec2
1.On-demand instances
2.reserved instances
3.spot instances
4.Dedicated instances

On-demand instances:
*In this model, based on the instances you choose, you pay for compute capacity per hour or second(only for linux instances)
no upfront payments are needed
* On-Demand instances is recommended for users who prefer low cost and flexible ec2 instance with out upfront payments or 
long-term commitments

Spot instances:
*These instances are available at up to 90% discount compared to on-demand instances
*Spot instances fluctuates periodically based on supply and demand
*users can large scale dynamic workload can choose amazon ec2 spot instances

Reserved instances:
*Customers can commit to using ec2 over a 1-3 year term to reduce their total computing costs.
*Reserved instances can provide sufficient savings compared to on-demand instances

Dedicated instances:
* Who choose Dedicated hosts have to pay the on-demand price for every hour the host is active in the account.It only supports 
the per-hour billing and does not support per-second billing scheme.



IP Address:
* An Ipaddress is a unique address that defines a device on the internet or a local network.

Public IP address:
*this ip address  connects you to the world, and it's unique for all users.
Private IP address:
*These IP addresses are not routed on the internet and no traffic can be sent to them from the internet, they only 
 suppose to work within the local network only.
 
Port Number:

* Port number is used to identify an processes/servies on your system
* we have 65,535 possible  port numbers

* file transfer protocol: It is used to tranferring files between a client and a server : port 20 &21
* simple Mail transfer protocol: it is used for email : port 25
*secure shell :it creates the secure network connections : port 22
* Domain name system(DNS): it is essential process for the modern internet; it matches human readable domain names to machine
readable IP addresses: port 53
* port 80 : http(hyper text transfer protocol) it makes the world wide web possible.
* port 443: https
* port 3389 : remote desktop : it enables users to remotely connect to their desktop computers from another desktop

fdisk -l :  it shows whether the disk is properly attached or not

LVM creation
  
physical volume : pvs
 
volume group    :vgcreate [volumegroup name] [physical volume name]- vloume creation

we can verify the volume group creation by using vgdisplay

lv creation

lvcreate -n[LVname] -L[lv size][VG name from which LV will create]

finally Update the file system mkfs -t

finally create a directory and mount your LVM into particular directory

using mount cmd it not be mount permanantly

temporary mount : whenver restarting the server again this particular partition will not be visable with df -h
data will not be corrupted but volume will not be in use case but it is in ready 

df -h : it showa the disk space details

we want to mount permananet on that time we will use /etc/fstab

blkid : it shows the all devices UUID's

LV Will take up the space from Volume group 

quick refresh of the background we will use based upon the file system resize2fs
